# TD-Website

Our team's website updates

The `master` branch contains the current version of the website, as of now.
Every branch is created with the year stamp of every major update of the website.

## How to contribute

The fundamentals are:

 1. Fork the project & clone locally.
 2. Create an upstream remote and sync your local copy before you branch.
 3. Branch for each separate piece of work.
 4. Do the work, write good commit messages, and read the CONTRIBUTING file if there is one.
 5. Push to your origin repository.
 6. Create a new PR in GitHub.
 7. Respond to any code review feedback.
